Coco Soul Cold Pressed Virgin Coconut Oil (VCNO) Superfood is 100% pure and natural.
It is specifically prepared from fresh raw coconuts through a meticulous No Heat Process; a cold extraction technology which helps preserve the vital nutrients, rich aroma and flavour of real coconuts, making it fit for raw consumption.
VCNO Superfood is one of the richest plant-based sources of naturally occurring Medium Chain Triglycerides (MCTs).
These MCTs contribute to 60% of the total fatty acid content and unlike long-chain saturated fats, get rapidly digested for instant energy release.
Its high content of naturally occurring Lauric acid (C12) and Vitamin E allows for an incredible array of health-promoting properties.
It can also help in weight management. The MCTs in VCNOÂ break down into ketones that can support cognition and memory function.
Due to its better oxidative stability, VCNO is a great cooking medium even at high temperatures.
Ingredients:
Virgin Cococnut oil
How to Use:
Serving Size : 4-5 Teaspoons a day for Direct consumption|It can be used for cooking, marinating, frying, baking and sauces.
It enhances the taste in smoothies, shakes and is a salad dressing.

Coco Soul Cold Pressed Virgin Coconut Oil (VCNO) Superfood is 100% pure and natural. It is specifically prepared from fresh raw coconuts through a meticulous No Heat Process; a cold extraction technology which helps preserve the vital nutrients, rich aroma and flavour of real coconuts, making it fit for raw consumption. VCNO Superfood is one of the richest plant-based sources of naturally occurring Medium Chain Triglycerides (MCTs). These MCTs contribute to 60% of the total fatty acid content and unlike long-chain saturated fats, get rapidly digested for instant energy release. Its high content of naturally occurring Lauric acid (C12) and Vitamin E allows for an incredible array of health-promoting properties. It can also help in weight management. The MCTs in VCNOÂ break down into ketones that can support cognition and memory function. Due to its better oxidative stability, VCNO is a great cooking medium even at high temperatures.
How to Use:
Serving Size : 4-5 Teaspoons a day for Direct consumption|It can be used for cooking, marinating, frying, baking and sauces. It enhances the taste in smoothies, shakes and is a salad dressing.

These tiny black cumin seeds go by various regional names, but pack a solid punch in terms of flavour - imagine a nutty, slightly bitter taste with undertones of onion and pepper. Nigella or kalonji form one of the five spices in East Indian and Bangladeshi panch phoron, a spice mix made with five seeds and used to flavour lentil stews and vegetable stir-fries. You might also recognise it as the black seeds traditionally flecking soft, buttery naan bread! Other cultures use nigella in baking, for the crunch and the onion-like flavour. Try sprinkling some on bread, bagels and croissants for a new flavour dimension, or add it to salad dressings for texture. JK Masala's especially packed nigella seeds will be a lovely, flavourful addition to your spice rack!

How to Use:
It can be used for frying, roasting and baking.
The terms used in olive oil tasting are similar to those used in wine tasting. Good oil should be balanced, with the body and round flavours that develop in the mouth. General terms such as fruity, mature, pungent, bitter or sweet are used alongside other more specific associations such as grass, green leaves, almond or apple.
Pour approximately 1 tablespoon of Olive Oil in a small glass. Cover the glass with one hand and shake it delicately until the oil sticks on to the entire inside surface. Warm the oil in the glass with your hands till it is close to body temperature.
Lift the glass to your nose and sniff thrice, deeply (raising your nose up and away from the oil between each sniff).
Olive oils have aromas just like wine. Take a sip (approx. 10 drops into the mouth). Roll the olive oil around in your mouth for approximately 5 seconds.
The oil should touch all areas of the mouth so that the various tastes and sensations can be noted. Between tasting each kind of olive oil, drink lots of water and eat a small piece of bread to cleanse your palate.

Extra Virgin Olive Oil.

Pure Ghee Sourced from the Land of the Tharparkar Cows: Our Desi Cow A2 Ghee is procured from the milk of the Tharparkar cows - which are a cow breed indigenous to the Thar Desert of India. These cows are grass-fed and are not factory-farmed, and are free from cross-breeding, which gives our Ghee its special natural qualities. An Ancient Secret Passed Down Through Generations: We employ a traditional 3000-year-old Vedic method originating in a Rajasthani village called Bilona (hand-churn) to craft our A2 ghee. The process involves boiling raw unprocessed cow milk and then converting it to curd in a clay pot. Furthermore, the curd is hand-churned (from the boiled milk) to help retain the nutrients. The final step is separating the butter to form the ghee. Revel in the Richness of A2 Ghee: The A2 milk used to make our ghee contains beta-casein protein that's supremely rich in nutrients such as calcium, iron, sodium, and fat-soluble vitamins A, D, and E, as well as Omega-3 and Omega-6 fatty acids. Ghee obtained from curd instead of the cream of cows contains good fats and can be easily digested by the body - this is because it aids the gastric juices in your system to break down foods you consume. Heals and Nourishes the Body: Regular consumption of our high-quality A2 ghee helps reduce cholesterol, improves the heart's functioning, and reduces joint pain. It is also known for its external healing properties. You can apply it to soothe skin burns or sunburns. In winter months, you can use it as a moisturiser to get rid of dry and flaky skin. Healthy Bodies Beating Hearts: Our ghee is Keto and Paleo diet friendly. It is suitable for adults as well as children. Use our natural A2 ghee to add flavour to your favourite meals. Since it has a high heating point, it retains all the essential nutrients while cooking. The ways to experiment with our A2 ghee are exciting and unlimited.
How to Use:
Add it on the food to make it more flavourful.

Each cumin seed in this pack holds an ancient story. The one where medical practitioners in ancient India proclaimed it the best aid to digestion. The one where a spilt jar of the spice got kicked over and was buried for aeons, then excavated centuries later as part of a Syrian heritage site. The one where it occupied pride of place in its own container at a dinner table, right next to salt and pepper, in ancient Greece. The one where its significance was recorded in the Bible and the Old Testament. Which one is your favourite? Is it the one where the seed travelled to the Americas with Spanish sailors who had discovered that it helped preserve food on long voyages? The one where it slowly became the mainstay of Mexican and Latin American food over the years, joining ranks with Middle Eastern and Indian spice blends? Is it the one where it journeyed all the way to the Netherlands and became a mainstay of cheese from Leden? We’ll tell you what our favourite story is. It’s the one where our cumin makes its way from our family to yours, landing right in the midst of the magic happening in your kitchen, on your stovetop, in a burst of warmth and full-bodied flavour.
