Jowar, otherwise known as Sorghum, is a robust grain that has been cultivated in India for many centuries. It is primarily grown in the arid regions of Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh and is a significant part of the rural Indian diet. The versatility of this grain lends itself to a host of Indian dishes. When milled into flour, it is used to make 'Jowar roti' or 'bhakri', staple flatbreads in the western and southern regions of India. It is also used in 'khichdi', a comforting one-pot dish. Whole Jowar kernels, known as 'Jowar Dhani', are popped like popcorn and enjoyed as a hearty snack. Jowar's resilience to drought conditions, coupled with its nutritional value and culinary versatility, make it an essential crop in India's agricultural landscape. Its recent resurgence in urban areas signifies a return to traditional ingredients amidst growing health consciousness.
