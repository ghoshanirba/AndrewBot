Rice flour, a staple in Indian cuisine, is finely ground from polished white rice, offering both versatility and cultural significance. Widely used in dishes like dosa and idli, it contributes to their distinctive textures and flavours without focusing excessively on health benefits. It's fine texture also enhances the crispiness of snacks like pakoras and papads when deep-fried, while its ability to thicken gravies and sauces adds richness to various culinary creations. Additionally, rice flour is essential in traditional Indian sweets such as ladoo, imparting a soft, melt-in-the-mouth consistency. As such, rice flour remains indispensable in both traditional and modern Indian cooking practices.

Sabudana, also known as sago, is a starchy substance common in Indian cuisine. Derived from the pith of tropical palm trees, it's popularly consumed during religious fasting periods. Sabudana is often processed into small, pearl-like balls that turn translucent when cooked. Its mild flavour makes it a versatile ingredient, suitable for both sweet and savory dishes. Sabudana Khichdi, a spiced tapioca dish, and Sabudana Vada, a deep-fried snack, are classic examples of its use. For dessert, it's often used in puddings like Sabudana Kheer. Its unique texture and taste make it a culinary delight.

About the Product
Stay in the pink of your health with GoodDiet Himalayan Pink Rock Salt. This salt comes in the form of tiny crystals, found naturally in the Himalayas and contains magnesium, potassium, required sodium, and 84 other traces of minerals that are not present in common salt. Low in sodium and high in flavour, a tiny amount of pink salt can go a long way in enhancing your dishes.
As the core ingredient, Pink Salt plays two roles - It reduces bitter flavours and makes the rest of the flavour pop and also helps to balance the pH levels in the body, flushes out toxins, keeps you hydrated at all times and improves your energy. Your table salt also undergoes a refining process that removes its impurities and any other mineral besides sodium chloride. However, BB GoodDiet's Himalayan Rock Salt comes with its own health benefits.
Ingredients:
Natural Rock Salt.
Benefits:
Helps to improve respiratory diseases.
Balances your body's pH 3.
Help reduce signs of ageing.
Helps regulate blood sugar levels.
Helps improve the quality of sleep.
An easy replacement option for your table salt that is suitable for people of all age groups.
It is very much similar to black salt powder.
It provides necessary nourishment and brings purity & taste to the table to enjoy.
How to Use:
Open the pack and add BB GoodDiet's Himalayan Pink Rock Salt (powder) to the dish according to your choice of taste.

Idli rice is a type of rice specifically used for making idlis, a traditional South Indian steamed rice cake. Idli rice is different from regular white rice in that it undergoes a parboiling process before milling, which involves partially boiling the rice in its husk. This process helps retain more nutrients in the grain. Idli rice has a slightly coarse texture and is softer than regular rice when cooked, making it ideal for preparing soft and fluffy idlis. It is also used to make dosas (South Indian crepes) and other South Indian rice-based dishes.

Idli Sooji, also known as Idli Rava, is a core ingredient in the making of a popular South Indian dish, Idli. It is a type of semolina that is coarsely ground to a texture that is between typical Sooji (semolina) and whole rice. Idli Sooji is primarily used to prepare soft, fluffy, and melt-in-mouth idlis that are a staple breakfast item in Southern India.    Preparing Idli with Sooji is convenient as it eliminates the need for soaking, grinding, and fermenting the rice, which is the traditional method. Idli Sooji is mixed with urad dal batter to make idlis. The mixture is then steamed in moulds to achieve the characteristic round shape.    The result is a delicious, light, and spongy idli that can be served with a variety of chutneys, sambar, or even eaten plain. It's not just a breakfast item; these idlis make for a wholesome and satisfying meal any time of the day. The neutral taste of idli sooji makes it a versatile ingredient, allowing it to be flavoured according to individual preferences.

Cardamom, often referred to as 'Elaichi' in Hindi, is a spice native to the Indian subcontinent. It is recognized by its small seed pods, triangular in cross-section and spindle-shaped, with a thin, papery outer shell. The pods are used as flavouring agents in both food and drink, as cooking spices and as a medicine. Elaichi has a sweet, pungent taste and a strong, unique fragrance, which is why it is extensively used for culinary purposes. It lends a distinct aroma and a sweet, spicy flavour to dishes and desserts. Apart from being a versatile culinary spice, it is often used as a traditional remedy in Ayurvedic medicine for its distinct therapeutic properties. Not just the pods, even the cardamom seeds and the cardamom oil are brimming with goodness. It's a spice that is integral to Indian cuisine and is as much valued for its flavour as for its wellness benefits.

40181477,Cold Pressed Sesame/Gingelly Cooking Oil,1000,1 L,ml,,600,,446,,446,L,446,26% OFF,BB Royal Organic,"Foodgrains, Oil & Masala",Organic Staples,"Organic Edible Oil, Ghee",3.8,N,"About the Product:
bb Royal Organic Cold Pressed Sesame Cooking Oil, also known as Til oil or Gingelly oil, is extracted from certified organic sesame seeds by pressing in an expeller under low-temperature conditions, known as cold pressing, resulting in a healthy and nutritious oil with a mild and pleasant flavour. Sesame oil has a slightly nutty taste, making it excellent for stir-fried dishes and salad dressings. Explore bb Royal Organics' full range of Organic Oils and Ghee to add quality and yumminess to your meals.
Benefits:
Nutritional Value: Sesame/Gingelly Cooking Oil is known for its high nutritional value. It is rich in essential fatty acids, including omega-6 fatty acids, which are beneficial for heart health and overall well-being. Antioxidant Properties: This oil is packed with antioxidants such as sesamol and sesamin, which help protect the body against oxidative stress and free radicals. These antioxidants contribute to a healthy immune system and may reduce the risk of chronic diseases. Heart Health: Sesame/Gingelly Cooking Oil is a heart-healthy choice due to its high content of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats. These fats help lower LDL (bad) cholesterol levels and may reduce the risk of heart disease when used as part of a balanced diet. Anti-inflammatory Effects: The oil contains compounds that have anti-inflammatory properties, which can help reduce inflammation in the body and potentially alleviate symptoms of conditions like arthritis and other inflammatory disorders. Note: BB Royal Organic Sesame Oil is free from any anti-foaming agents and hence may foam when heated. To reduce foaming, add a pea-sized piece of tamarind to the oil while heating. Foaming indicates the oil is minimally processed and pure. |
How to Use:
Cold Pressed Sesame oil is good as a condiment or as a flavouring agent for salads. It can also be added to Indian curries and gravies. Storage Information: Keep in a clean and dry place away from direct heat and sunlight. |

Being chilli based, it provides an exotic red gravy to dishes. It is widely used all over India on account of its being a less pungent garam masala. Fennel, Tejpatta (Cinnamon leaves) and Trifala imparts a cooling effect to this blend. It is used essentially for preparing vegetarian dishes requiring a gravy. Gujaratis and Marwaris normally use it in lentils (dal) and for filling in snacks such as samosa, usal, patra, farsan etc.

Electric Cooker: Add 1 cup of rice to 2.0 cups of water and place it in an electric cooker, switch it on and wait for approximately 20 to 25 minutes. Allow it to cool for a few minutes and take out the rice to serve. Pressure Cooker: Add 1 cup of rice to 2.0 cups of water either directly in a pressure cooker or in compartment vessels, close the pressure cooker properly, put the whistle weight and keep the cooker on medium flame. Switch off the flame once 3 whistles are completed. Allow it to cool till the pressure in the cooker comes down completely, remove the weight and open the cooker to take out the rice to serve. Note: Water ratio may vary slightly for open cookware cooking when compared to pressure cooking. The water ratio may vary based on the texture of the rice you desire to have, like firm, soft, or sticky.
