Black Cardamom
How to Use:
Black cardamom pods can be used in soups, chowders, casseroles and marinades for a smoky flavour.
Black cardamom can be sautéed with vegetables and other whole spices to enhance its flavour before the rice is added to make Hyderabad Biriyani.
Badi Elaichi is what gives many gravies the smoky, intense flavour and gets imbibed in the gravy very well.
It also works well in herbal infusions and herbal tonics, chai and even coffee.

Safe harvest Kodo Millet Rice is procured from small and marginal farmer producer collectives from South Tamil Nadu. It has been carefully grown to ensure that you get safe food without synthetic pesticides and without using genetically modified seeds. All products of Safe harvest are tested in FSSAI accredited laboratories for the presence of 149 pesticides and a Minimum Residual Level report is obtained. Also, our millet rice is parboiled and unpolished that helps in retaining the essential nutrients. They are easily digestible, highly nutritious, and gluten-free and has a lesser percentage of glucose when compared to rice and thus lowers the risk of diabetes. Kodo millet has 8. 3% protein and 65. 2% carbohydrate when compared to paddy rice that has only 6. 8% protein but 78. 2% carbohydrates. Eating millets is a step towards sustainable cropping practices as millet is not a water-intensive crop like rice or wheat. Kodo millet rice is rich in phytates and thereby helps reduce the risk of cancer. Recommended for making such as Biriyani, Kheer.
