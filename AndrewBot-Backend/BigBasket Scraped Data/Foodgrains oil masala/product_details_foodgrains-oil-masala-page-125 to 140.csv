We're making it phenomenally easy to improve your life in a way, that will delight you every single day. Considering how much you loved our truly Indian chilli experiments, you'll be thrilled with what we've done with some of India's best spices. After all, we're a heat-loving nation second (see: fire), we're a spice loving nation first (see: flavour). So, after months of experimenting, we finally decided to make a truly Indian version of an international sensation that hits the right notes in so many different ways. A classic spice mix that has been around for decades and loved by people of different cultures, the Pumpkin Spice is much more than a 'fall flavour', it's a daily mood. We didn't make this flavour in a laboratory. There's no chemistry here. Just premium quality real spices blended to perfection to give you all the flavour and all the health benefits of each of the all-star ingredients.
What makes our Pumpkin Spice so unique is the perfect balance between some of the most intensely flavourful spices including nutmeg, cinnamon, ginger, clove, star anise and allspice. So when you add a dash of this mix to anything, no single note dominates completely, but what you'll experience is the perfect aroma, sweetness, and warm delicate flavours of these spices combined. And we honestly feel that everybody should be able to experience this taste upgrade. Adding our Pumpkin Spice to your beverage, dessert or soup is not just about flavours, but it's also so much about the feeling. It's like brewing an average cup of coffee and having a little sprinkle of some magic spice to make it taste like a barista's coffee. Ditto for your bakes, pancakes, french toast and more. Woof. And let's not forget about the Health Benefits.

Each cumin seed in this pack holds an ancient story. The one where medical practitioners in ancient India proclaimed it the best aid to digestion. The one where a spilt jar of the spice got kicked over and was buried for aeons, then excavated centuries later as part of a Syrian heritage site. The one where it occupied pride of place in its own container at a dinner table, right next to salt and pepper, in ancient Greece. The one where its significance was recorded in the Bible and the Old Testament. Which one is your favourite. Is it the one where the seed travelled to the Americas with Spanish sailors who had discovered that it helped preserve food on long voyages? The one where it slowly became the mainstay of Mexican and Latin American food over the years, joining ranks with Middle Eastern and Indian spice blends? Is it the one where it journeyed all the way to the Netherlands and became a mainstay of cheese from Leden? We’ll tell you what our favourite story is. It’s the one where our cumin makes its way from our family to yours, landing right in the midst of the magic happening in your kitchen, on your stovetop, in a burst of warmth and full-bodied flavour.
