Pine nuts are full of minerals and vitamins, which play an important role to improve your overall health.
The shell must be removed before the pine nut can be eaten and have a long shelf life if kept dry.
They can be eaten raw, have a soft texture and a sweet buttery flavour and are especially good in salads, pesto sauce and deserts.
They are deliciously toasted as this brings out their flavour and adds a little extra crunch.

Protein: 14 g.
Benefits:
Pine nuts are high in vitamin K, phosphorus, magnesium, zinc and manganese, which contribute to the maintenance of normal bones.
