PURE A2 VEDIC GHEE: Anveshan A2 VEDIC ghee is nutritious, healthy, and pure with A2 proteins made from A2 milk of Indian native cows. Unlike other ghee products that claim to be organic and without lactose, our ghee butter is 100% natural, produced by grass-fed Indian desi cow milk. The premium A2 milk from the Hallikar cows is first turned into curd by using a microbe culture. We then churn the curd with Bilona Method as mentioned in Ayurveda for hours to separate the butter before boiling it to turn it into ghee. 1L of our ghee comes from 25 litres of milk. Anveshan Vedic ghee contains no additives, no preservatives and no added colours, just wholesome goodness. Cow A2 Cultured Ghee is gluten-free, easy to digest and safe for most people with lactose or casein sensitivities. Harlikar cows are known for producing highly regarded A2 milk. Unlike regular milk, A2 milk contains only A2 protein which is healthier and safer than A1 protein.

Pure A2 Vedic Ghee: Anveshan A2 VEDIC ghee is nutritious, healthy, and pure with A2 proteins made from A2 milk of Indian native cows. Unlike other ghee products that claim to be organic and without lactose, our ghee butter is 100% natural, produced by grass-fed Indian desi cow milk.

Anveshan Vedic ghee contains no additives, no preservatives and no added colours, just wholesome goodness. Cow A2 Cultured Ghee is gluten-free, easy to digest and safe for most people with lactose or casein sensitivities. Harlikar cows are known for producing highly regarded A2 milk.

It can be used in velveting meat, to keep it tender when stirfrying, though some consider it a cheat that makes meat mushy.
Benefits:
Treat heartburn.
Soothe canker sores.
May improve exercise performance.
Relieve itchy skin and sunburns.
May slow the progression of chronic kidney disease.

About the Product













Authentic Organic A2 Cow Ghee: Fresho Organic A2 Cow Ghee is made from the milk of cows that carry the A2 beta-casein protein gene. Known for its easy digestibility, this protein is particularly beneficial for those with lactose sensitivities.
Produced With Organic A2 Cow Milk: Our Ghee is crafted from the milk of local cow breeds of Karnataka, including Malnad Gidda and Hallikar. This nutrient-dense milk infuses our Ghee with essential vitamins and fatty acids, narrating a rich, authentic tale.
Single Source Farm: The milk for our Ghee originates from a single farm, devoid of factory-farming practices. We maintain absolute control from the collection to the production of the milk, ensuring its organic quality is nothing short of the highest standard.
Traditional Bilona Method: We employ the centuries old Bilona method to produce our Ghee. Cultured butter is extracted from curd and slowly cooked over a gentle flame, resulting in the purest and most traditional form of Desi Ghee. This meticulous churning and simmering process lends our Bilona Ghee its unique flavour and nutty aroma.
Rich and Full-Bodied: Prepared using the Vedic method, our Ghee retains the unique attributes of traditional Indian Ghee. Its robust, velvety granules, healthy fats, golden hue, and silky texture contribute to its distinctive richness.
Pasture-Raised Cows: Our cows graze freely on green pastures and consume only organic grains. This ensures that the milk used in our Ghee is fresh and enhances its flavour, aroma, and nutritional quality. The cows' feed is grown organically, without any chemicals or pesticides.
Certified and Lab Tested: To assure its authenticity, Fresho Organic A2 Cow Ghee undergoes testing at NABL Accredited Labs for nutritional and quality standards and is certified by the ADITI Organic Certification Body.

Misri, also known as Diamond Sugar, is a type of confectionery sugar used extensively in Indian cuisine and traditional practices. Misri crystals are beautifully diamond-shaped, lending to its unique name. This unrefined sugar is made by continually pouring sugar syrup into large, shallow containers, where it crystallises into small, rock-like structures.    Misri is not just used as a sweetener in Indian desserts, but also holds significant cultural and religious value. It is often used in religious ceremonies, offered as prasad (blessed food) or used in rituals. Misri also plays a key role in Ayurveda for its numerous health benefits. It is believed to aid in digestion, provide instant energy when mixed with warm water or milk.    Despite its sweetness, Misri is considered healthier than refined sugar due to its natural and unprocessed nature. Its distinct texture, sweetness, and cultural significance make it a cherished ingredient in Indian households.
