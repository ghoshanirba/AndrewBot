The humble mustard seed has an immense historical and religious significance, having been mentioned in Biblical, Islamic, Jewish and Buddhist texts. It has also travelled down the years to become a mainstay of South Asian cooking, and is dry roasted or added as a tempering to a plethora of vegetable and meat dishes. It pairs exceptionally well with curry leaves and ginger and will help you create excellent breakfast, lunch and dinner dishes from around the Indian subcontinent. Sarson seeds are very popular in Bengali and Punjabi cooking and will help you create a robust kasundi as well as a tangy achaar. If you’re only making early forays into South Asian cooking, you can still use JK Masala's mustard seeds for other dishes in your repertoire - soak the seeds in some vinegar and grind them up to make a homemade, preservative-free mustard relish that you can use as a salad dressing or in sandwiches. You can also use them as a substitute for yellow mustard in homemade pickles for a smoky aftertaste!
