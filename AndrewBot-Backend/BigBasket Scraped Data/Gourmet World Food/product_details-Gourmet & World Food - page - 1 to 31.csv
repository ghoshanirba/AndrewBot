bb Royal Organic Cold Pressed Sesame Cooking Oil, also known as Til oil or Gingelly oil, is extracted from certified organic sesame seeds by pressing in an expeller under low-temperature conditions, known as cold pressing, resulting in a healthy and nutritious oil with a mild and pleasant flavour. Sesame oil has a slightly nutty taste, making it excellent for stir-fried dishes and salad dressings. Explore bb Royal Organics' full range of Organic Oils and Ghee to add quality and yumminess to your meals.
Benefits:
Nutritional Value: Sesame/Gingelly Cooking Oil is known for its high nutritional value. It is rich in essential fatty acids, including omega-6 fatty acids, which are beneficial for heart health and overall well-being. Antioxidant Properties: This oil is packed with antioxidants such as sesamol and sesamin, which help protect the body against oxidative stress and free radicals. These antioxidants contribute to a healthy immune system and may reduce the risk of chronic diseases. Heart Health: Sesame/Gingelly Cooking Oil is a heart-healthy choice due to its high content of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats. These fats help lower LDL (bad) cholesterol levels and may reduce the risk of heart disease when used as part of a balanced diet. Anti-inflammatory Effects: The oil contains compounds that have anti-inflammatory properties, which can help reduce inflammation in the body and potentially alleviate symptoms of conditions like arthritis and other inflammatory disorders. Note: BB Royal Organic Sesame Oil is free from any anti-foaming agents and hence may foam when heated. To reduce foaming, add a pea-sized piece of tamarind to the oil while heating. Foaming indicates the oil is minimally processed and pure. |
How to Use:
Cold Pressed Sesame oil is good as a condiment or as a flavouring agent for salads. It can also be added to Indian curries and gravies. Storage Information: Keep in a clean and dry place away from direct heat and sunlight. |

How to Use:
It can be used for frying, roasting and baking.
The terms used in olive oil tasting are similar to those used in wine tasting. Good oil should be balanced, with the body and round flavours that develop in the mouth. General terms such as fruity, mature, pungent, bitter or sweet are used alongside other more specific associations such as grass, green leaves, almond or apple.
Pour approximately 1 tablespoon of Olive Oil in a small glass. Cover the glass with one hand and shake it delicately until the oil sticks on to the entire inside surface. Warm the oil in the glass with your hands till it is close to body temperature.
Lift the glass to your nose and sniff thrice, deeply (raising your nose up and away from the oil between each sniff).
Olive oils have aromas just like wine. Take a sip (approx. 10 drops into the mouth). Roll the olive oil around in your mouth for approximately 5 seconds.
The oil should touch all areas of the mouth so that the various tastes and sensations can be noted. Between tasting each kind of olive oil, drink lots of water and eat a small piece of bread to cleanse your palate.

Extra Virgin Olive Oil.

What’s the perfect breakfast? It gets you started On everything! Protein, carbs, good fats, natural fibers, vitamins, minerals - it should get your day’s ticker rolling on all fronts. It keeps you up Ever felt like plonking right back into bed after breakfast? It’s not you…it’s the simple carbs (and refined sugars) leading to an insulin surge. It keeps you going Breakfast should get you to lunch. If it fizzles out midway (and your energy crashes by noon), it’s because the energy release was fast and spiky. Not slow and steady. We crafted these Mueslis to tick all those boxes and more.

Here are how: Balanced Macros: Unlike traditional breakfast cereals that are loaded with carbs (and little else), only half the energy here comes from carbs. And the other half from good fats & proteins.
Sustained Energy: The majority of the carbs are complex, slow-release carbs from whole grains. Which means steady energy release that gets you through the day.
Low Insulin Impact: The complex carbs and natural fibers help avoid a sudden insulin surge. No spikes and crashes.
No refined sugar: Sugar ain’t bad. Refined, nutritionally empty sugar is. So to sweeten this Muesli we found Kakvi. A dark, golden liquid used for ages in rural, coastal India - it’s the most un-refined form of sugarcane you can find. And it’s even more nutritious than jaggery!
Portion controlled: The real problem with sugary breakfast cereal is how much we eat of it. Both as breakfast and generally - as a snack. That’s why we send you a measuring scoop. 2 scoops = 1 serving = ~220 calories. Another 120cal from 200ml milk - and your morning is sorted under 350cal! But no cheating, ok!

What’s the perfect breakfast? It gets you started On everything! Protein, carbs, good fats, natural fibers, vitamins, minerals - it should get your day’s ticker rolling on all fronts. It keeps you up Ever felt like plonking right back into bed after breakfast? It’s not you…it’s the simple carbs (and refined sugars) leading to an insulin surge. It keeps you going Breakfast should get you to lunch. If it fizzles out midway (and your energy crashes by noon), it’s because the energy release was fast and spiky. Not slow and steady. We crafted these Mueslis to tick all those boxes and more.
Here are how: Balanced Macros: Unlike traditional breakfast cereals that are loaded with carbs (and little else), only half the energy here comes from carbs. And the other half from good fats & proteins. Sustained Energy: The majority of the carbs are complex, slow-release carbs from whole grains. Which means steady energy release that gets you through the day. Low Insulin Impact: The complex carbs and natural fibres help avoid a sudden insulin surge. No spikes and crashes. No refined sugar: No refined sugar: Sugar ain’t bad. Refined, nutritionally empty sugar is.
PS: We have a 'No added sugar' muesli now if you'd like.
Portion controlled: The real problem with sugary breakfast cereal is how much we eat of it. Both as breakfast and generally - as a snack. That’s why we send you a measuring scoop. 2 scoops = 1 serving = ~220 calories. Another 120cal from 200ml milk - and your morning is sorted under 350cal! But no cheating, ok!

Buckwheat (kuttu) is one of the world’s oldest crops and is believed to have originated in Southeast Asia around 6000 years ago.

Graminway’s Gluten-Free Kuttu Atta is made from locally sourced buckwheat grown by farmers who use sustainable farming methods, without chemicals or pesticides. Buckwheat can be made into a finely powdered, refined flour for a milder flavour or into a coarser, darker form for bolder flavours and more fibre content.
