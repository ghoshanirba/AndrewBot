Hibiscus Lime A probiotic drink made with this mystical flower: hibiscus which helps you cleanse your mind and soul. A pinch of lemon adds Vitamin C to boost your immunity. Hibiscus - Hibiscus has a long history of being a medicinal plant and has been used in a number of traditional medicinal remedies. It contains an abundance of antioxidants and this is believed to help protect the body against free radicals. What are free radicals? Well, this might get a little technical but stay with me. Oxygen in the body splits into single atoms with unpaid electrons. The electrons like to be paired so these atoms are called free radicals. These atoms then damage the cells in the body by causing a change in the cell membranes and DNA. This abnormality results in diseases like cancer, diabetes, asthma, senile dementia etc. To reduce free radicals one needs to have antioxidant-rich food that neutralizes the free radicals

Features:
A bottle of Gatorade contains salt, sucrose, sodium citrate, monopotassium phosphate, Dextrose natural lime and lemon flavours along with other permissible food flavours.
When you take part in sports and games, you tend to sweat profusely; this means that the body loses critical electrolytes like potassium and sodium.
The absence of these essential nutrients in the body cause a communication gap between the brain and the muscles leading to bad performance and lack of muscle coordination.
This sports drink is extremely favourable for long bouts of training because it replenishes the body with essential nutrients and helps to regulate the balance of fluid within the body.
How to Use:
This is a must-have if you are part of a rigorous and extensive training session. Gatorade can be used before and after a work out to ensure that you do not lose steam when you sweat. You can take sips of this in between an intense work out.
