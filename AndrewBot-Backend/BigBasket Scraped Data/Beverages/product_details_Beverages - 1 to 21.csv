The sweet taste of nature’s coolest hydrant is reminiscent of many evenings at the beach. We’d have just enough money for one treat. After a sweaty evening filled with activities like running and playing ball, the whole bunch of cousins, elder ones being in charge, of course, would invariably end up at their favourite nariyal pani wala who would help us pick the sweetest coconuts (it’s still a mystery to me how they can always tell those ones apart). To think that all these years later, we still pick a nariyal pani to cool down on a hot summer day, that says a lot about our allegiance to this natural coolant. Sadly there’s not as much playtime anymore but as long as there’s coconut water, all we got to do is shut our eyes and be transported, giggles, laughter and all.

Growing up, this scaly fruit fascinated all of us. A magic fruit that’s hard from the outside but super soft on the inside, is a fruit but could easily pass for a dessert. Yup! That’s Lychee for you! While the taste of lychee was hard not to love, peeling it was a total mood kill. Being the baby of the family we would get away with a lot of things and lychee-peeling ceremony was definitely one of them. 
 Eating lychees while sitting around in our night suits post dinner. Maa peeling at this tropical wonder with an extra fan (vintage, fished out from storage) pointed in our direction is how I shall forever remember childhood summers. The sweet, fleshy fruit still evokes that same sense of happy, lazy summer nostalgia in me. Thank God for juice though, no pleading about peeling necessary!

Bones form the structural framework of the human body. Up until the age of 30, bone formation is faster than bone loss, which causes the skeleton to grow both in size and density, resulting in an overall increase in bone mass. After the age of 30, bone mineral density may start to decrease. Unfortunately, there are no visible signs of weak bones. They often go unnoticed over many years, with no symptoms or discomfort until a bone breaks. To maintain strong bones, you don’t just need an adequate intake of Calcium, but also Vitamin D for Calcium absorption and Vitamin K2 for binding Calcium to bones, daily. Remember, Vitamin K2 is not commonly found in the Indian diet, and Vitamin D is not even available in your daily diet. Horlicks Women’s Plus is a bone nutrition specialist powered with CALSEAL formula. It provides 100% RDA^ of Calcium, Vitamin D & Vitamin K2 requirements.

An apple a day keeps the doctor away might just be the main mantra of the Indian parent's handbook, no? Which kid wasn't raised with sermons on how one must eat apples for health? It's a good thing that this biblical fruit is juicy, tasty and fulfilling or else we really have a bone to pick with our parents. Growing up we had a family joke, that no matter what time of the day you tell mom youre hungry she has a standard response, apple khaa lo. In fact, we reached a point where we would ask her just for this automated response and then giggle away to glory. In our household, apples were not just the breakfast fruit, however, because we made warm apple pies and trifle pudding with apple pieces regularly. The unsung hero of fruits, it truly was versatile and is the family's go-to snack option to this day!

Bones form the structural framework of the human body. Up until the age of 30, bone formation is faster than bone loss, which causes the skeleton to grow both in size and density, resulting in an overall increase in bone mass. After the age of 30, bone mineral density may start to decrease. Unfortunately, there are no visible signs of weak bones. They often go unnoticed over many years, with no symptoms or discomfort until a bone breaks. To maintain strong bones, you don’t just need an adequate intake of Calcium, but also Vitamin D for Calcium absorption and Vitamin K2 for binding Calcium to bones, daily. Remember, Vitamin K2 is not commonly found in the Indian diet, and Vitamin D is not even available in your daily diet.

Hibiscus Lime A probiotic drink made with this mystical flower: hibiscus which helps you cleanse your mind and soul. A pinch of lemon adds Vitamin C to boost your immunity. Hibiscus - Hibiscus has a long history of being a medicinal plant and has been used in a number of traditional medicinal remedies. It contains an abundance of antioxidants and this is believed to help protect the body against free radicals. What are free radicals? Well, this might get a little technical but stay with me. Oxygen in the body splits into single atoms with unpaid electrons. The electrons like to be paired so these atoms are called free radicals. These atoms then damage the cells in the body by causing a change in the cell membranes and DNA. This abnormality results in diseases like cancer, diabetes, asthma, senile dementia etc. To reduce free radicals one needs to have antioxidant-rich food that neutralizes the free radicals

Features:
A bottle of Gatorade contains salt, sucrose, sodium citrate, monopotassium phosphate, Dextrose natural lime and lemon flavours along with other permissible food flavours.
When you take part in sports and games, you tend to sweat profusely; this means that the body loses critical electrolytes like potassium and sodium.
The absence of these essential nutrients in the body cause a communication gap between the brain and the muscles leading to bad performance and lack of muscle coordination.
This sports drink is extremely favourable for long bouts of training because it replenishes the body with essential nutrients and helps to regulate the balance of fluid within the body.
How to Use:
This is a must-have if you are part of a rigorous and extensive training session. Gatorade can be used before and after a work out to ensure that you do not lose steam when you sweat. You can take sips of this in between an intense work out.
