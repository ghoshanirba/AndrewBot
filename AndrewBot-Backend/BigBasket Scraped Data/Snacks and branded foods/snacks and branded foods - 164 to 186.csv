From being a part of the Spice Route to metamorphosing into the largest producer of spices in the world, India has come a long way as far as culturing the spice factor goes. Back home, spices were chosen, measured, pounded and mixed, all in the kitchen with hours on end to prepare these recipes passed down by generations. Today however all of the homes using DNV spices benefit from a uniform, authentic taste and aroma of traditional cuisine.
Besides, there is also an element of bringing diversified India closer to each other by packaging the taste and aroma of a particular region, uniformly across the country. For instance, a Dal Bati Churma will taste the same in Kolkata as well as Udaipur. Team DNV is in diversified fields of business under different group companies. With a presence of over 75 years in the spices industry, the team was primarily in the business of whole selling spices pan-India. We present to you this tasty sauce, from our range of delicious Indian Sauce collections. Being tangy, spicy and an all-time favourite, this sauce is made with healthy and fresh pickups. DNV sauces are made using the best quality ingredients, which makes the sauce healthier and tastier while retaining the traditional touch!

Maintaining a high protein foods diet is not everyone's cup of tea, especially when food for strong muscles and bones ends up being mundane. We noticed that the Indian population lacks proper nutrition in their diet, we wanted to have a product that literally tasted like a jar of freshly roasted peanuts. What we achieved finally, was a spread that was not biased to any particular age group, and an essential ingredient in a healthy diet for women, men and kids. Be it a meal plan for weight loss, or pre and post-workout meals or just mid-day snacks, Alpino fits right everywhere. Alpino offers different peanut butter flavours to end the tug of war between health and desserts.

Litties are stuffed balls that are often roasted over charcoal, though they can also be baked. Chokha is served with litties. A dip called chokha is made by mashing potatoes, tomatoes, or eggplant with spices. It can be added to water along with sugar or salt and few spices and made into a refreshing drink. It can also be used in kebabs and cutlets. Thus from sweet dishes to savoury food and drinks, sattu can be converted into many delicious and fulfilling meals! In the summer, a Sattu-based beverage is a terrific way to satisfy your thirst. It drastically lowers body temperature and keeps the body from overheating. Sattu is created by dry roasting, which locks in all the nutrients. Protein, fibre, calcium, iron, manganese, and magnesium are all abundant in it. The high insoluble fibre content of Sattu is excellent for the intestines. It detoxifies the colon from acidity, constipation, and greasy meals. Sattu is a low-GI cuisine and a fantastic choice for diabetics. It controls blood pressure and maintains blood sugar levels. It is excellent for people with high cholesterol because of its high fibre content.
