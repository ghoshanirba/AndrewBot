What you see is what you eat! We believe in the wholesome goodness of our ingredients and do not crush them. Every Mojo Bar contains 100% whole grains, nuts and fruits. Mojo Bars have the right proportion of good fats, protein, vitamins, fibre and carbs recommended by nutritionists for snack time meals.
An ideal calorie snack that is the same inside-out. Control your hunger pangs with wholesome goodness of our ingredients natural ingredients.
It is easy to overindulge on snacks when you get hungry,"" says Laura Catalusci, MA, a certified health education specialist in New York. Every Mojo Bar has been portioned perfectly to only contain 140-160 calories (depending on the variant).
As Indians (whose mothers strongly believe that Ã¢â‚¬ËœDahiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is the solution to most things) we have grown up with yoghurt and developed a special relationship with it. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s our go-to comfort food and of course very healthy. Having realized that this is such an integral part of so many homes, we decided to tip our hats to it. Combining it with cranberries and cereal and mixing in almonds and watermelon seeds for some added crunch, we have perfected the balance between the sweet and the sour. While the bar retains the signature tangy-ness of the yoghurt and cranberries, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just the right amount of sweet from the honey to balance it out! This bar combines curd with cranberries, cereal, almonds and watermelon seeds to make a sweet and sour crunchy bar. 
Balanced snack, gluten-free, rich in fibre, rich in protein, no preservatives, no artificial sugar, a good source of energy. Relish this delicious and healthy snack and share it with your loved ones.

Graminway Spicy Jackfruit Pickle is a delicacy filled up to the brim by the tangy and mouth-watering jackfruit pieces. It is a blend of chunks of tender raw jackfruit (kathal) along with the flavours of raw mango, turmeric, red chilli, fenugreek, onion seeds, fennel seeds, and select spices. Pickles play a key role in Indian cuisine. No Indian meal is complete without a smidgen of a pickle. Relish it with a leftover puri, fresh paratha, mathri, office tiffin box, dal chawal, plain white rice, or as an accompaniment with any other regular meal. Each raw jackfruit is carefully washed, dried, and cut into pieces before pickling. Graminway aims to provide clean, natural, and healthy products without compromising on the flavours and taste. They produce them in small batches, which helps maintain freshness and preserve the ingredient texture. By not stockpiling, each product is as fresh as possible when it reaches your doorstep.
