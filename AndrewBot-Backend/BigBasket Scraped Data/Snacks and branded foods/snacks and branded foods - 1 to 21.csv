About the Product
The ID Fresho idli/dosa batter is a ready-made mix that saves your time and energy to create a dosa batter from scratch. Idli and dosa are the most popular healthy South Indian foods. They are made from rice and black lentils. Idlis are made in a specialised mould and eaten with different items like chutney, vegetable stew or other flavourful toppings for breakfast or as a snack.
Typically, an idli/dosa batter involves a three-step recipe which includes soaking the rice, grinding and fermenting it. But with this readymade batter, you can make crispy dosa and fluffy soft idlis in no time at all. This Batter serves to cook 37 to 40 idlis and 26 to 28 dosas. Idlis contain no cholesterol, no fat, and no saturated fat. These small healthy South Indian food treats are good for you and, as a bonus, convenient for those on the go. To make your diet a bit healthier, swap a doughnut or muffin for healthy South Indian food idli/dosa.

You get the lip-smacking and iconic Britannia 5050 Sweet & Salty biscuit – a biscuit that is deliciously sweet and scrumptiously salty.

How to Use:
You need to preheat the oil before frying the tikkis; the tikkis can be simply taken out of the freezer and put in the oil directly. They do not need time to thaw. If you are cooking smaller amounts, reduce the cooking time. It is best to take them out of the oven when you see a hint of light golden colour on the outside, which should happen within 3 minutes of cooking. Overcooking the tikkis will spoil their taste.
