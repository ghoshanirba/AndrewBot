Excellent Source Of Nutrients: Makhanas are an excellent source of several important nutrients and are a terrific addition to a healthy, well-rounded diet. They contain a good amount of carbs in each serving and are also rich in several micro-nutrients, including calcium, magnesium, iron, & phosphorus.
Rich In Protein & Fibre: Adding Makhanas to your diet is a wonderful way to boost your intake of protein & fibre - the two key nutrients that may benefit weight loss.
Protein has been proven to reduce food cravings & help regulate your appetite. Meanwhile, fibre moves slowly through your digestive tract to keep you feeling full during the day.
Low Glycemic Index: Glycemic Index indicates how fast sugar is being absorbed into our blood. Higher GI increases the insulin level which in turn increases sugar level in the body, and hence is not suggested to be consumed by a diabetic patient. Whereas Makhanas have lower GI, which means it will take time for the sugar to get absorbed in the blood, and hence is much safer to be consumed by a diabetic patient.
Makes Bones Strong: Makhanas are rich in calcium. Calcium improves bone & cartilage health, lubricates your bones & joints, & prevents degenerative bone diseases. Consume Makhanas daily with milk to improve your bone health & density.
Ingredients:
Roasted Makhana, Olive Oil, Spices & Condiments
How to Use:
Ready to eat.

Excellent Source of Nutrients: Makhanas are an excellent source of several important nutrients and are a terrific addition to a healthy, well-rounded diet. They contain a good amount of carbs in each serving and are also rich in several micro-nutrients, including calcium, magnesium, iron, & phosphorus.
Rich In Protein & Fibre: Adding Makhanas to your diet is a wonderful way to boost your intake of protein & fibre - the two key nutrients that may benefit weight loss.
Protein, in particular, has been proven to reduce food cravings & help regulate your appetite. Meanwhile, fibre moves slowly through your digestive tract to keep you feeling full during the day.
Low Glycemic Index: Glycemic Index indicates how fast sugar is being absorbed into our blood. Higher GI increases the insulin level which in turn increases sugar level in the body, and hence is not suggested to be consumed by a diabetic patient. Whereas Makhanas have lower GI, which means it will take time for the sugar to get absorbed in the blood, and hence is much safer to be consumed by a diabetic patient.
Makes Bones Strong: Makhanas are rich in calcium. Calcium improves bone & cartilage health, lubricates your bones & joints, & prevents degenerative bone diseases. Consume Makhanas daily with milk to improve your bone health & density.
Ingredients:
Roasted Makhana, Olive Oil, Spices & Condiments
