What’s the perfect breakfast? It gets you started On everything! Protein, carbs, good fats, natural fibers, vitamins, minerals - it should get your day’s ticker rolling on all fronts. It keeps you up Ever felt like plonking right back into bed after breakfast? It’s not you…it’s the simple carbs (and refined sugars) leading to an insulin surge. It keeps you going Breakfast should get you to lunch. If it fizzles out midway (and your energy crashes by noon), it’s because the energy release was fast and spiky. Not slow and steady. We crafted these Mueslis to tick all those boxes and more. Here are how: Balanced Macros: Unlike traditional breakfast cereals that are loaded with carbs (and little else), only half the energy here comes from carbs. And the other half from good fats & proteins.
Sustained Energy: The majority of the carbs are complex, slow-release carbs from whole grains. Which means a steady energy release that gets you through the day. Low Insulin Impact: The complex carbs and natural fibres help avoid a sudden insulin surge. No spikes and crashes. No refined sugar, No Sugar ain’t bad. Refined, nutritionally empty sugar is.
PS: We have a 'No added sugar' muesli now if you'd like. Portion controlled: The real problem with sugary breakfast cereal is how much we eat of it. Both as breakfast and generally - as a snack. That’s why we send you a measuring scoop. 2 scoops = 1 serving = ~220 calories. Another 120cal from 200ml milk - and your morning is sorted under 350cal! But no cheating, ok!
