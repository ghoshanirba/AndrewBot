Nutoras Halloumi is a Cypriot firm, brined, slightly springy white cheese. Its texture is similar to that of mozzarella or thick feta, except that it has a strong, salty flavour imbibed from the brine preserve. Cooking the Halloumi removes all its saltiness and empowers it with a creamy texture. Since the cheese has a high melting point, it can be easily fried or grilled.

The milk used to make this cheese is produced by our well-nourished, healthy and stress-free cows. We feed our cows organic fodder which is free from synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. They also roam freely in a paddock area with access to organic pasture and clean drinking water. ? In the traditional artisanal method, the freshly made cheese is pressed into blocks and aged in ripening rooms for 3 months. They are checked every day to ensure the finest quality Mozzarella Cheese is mould-free. ? The ageing process naturally enhances the life of this supreme quality cheese. It also helps in reducing the moisture content in the cheese, leaving behind a solid chunk of cheesy goodness. From cheese pizzas to corn cheese balls, our Mozzarella cheese pairs beautifully with a range of world-famous cuisines.

Cheddar cheese is the most popular type of cheese in the UK. Akshayakalpa Cheddar Cheese is handcrafted, organic, and an absolute delight for cheese lovers. No preservatives, artificial additives or flavouring, and emulsifiers are used in this mild cheddar cheese.Unlike industrial methods where artificial emulsifiers and preservatives are used, our cheese is preserved using 100% natural Himalayan Pink Salt for longer life. ? The milk used to make this delectable cheese is produced by our well-nourished, stress-free and healthy cows. Our cattle are fed pesticide-free fodder and allowed to roam freely in open paddock areas which have an abundance of organic pasture and clean drinking water. ? Made using the artisanal method, we add microbial rennet to produce fresh cheddar instead of animal rennet. The cheese blocks are aged for 3 months in ripening rooms where extensive checks are conducted every day to keep them mould-free. ? Ageing the cheese helps in reducing the moisture content present in the cheese, naturally enhancing its overall flavour and life.
