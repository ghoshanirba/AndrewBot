Of all the things the Greeks have given us, democracy and yoghurt take the top spots. While the former is of no use when you're hungry, a cup of Epigamia Greek yoghurt is just perfect. Epigamia was the term used for marriage between two city-states in ancient Greece. We have adopted this word to talk about our celebration of the marriage of health and taste in our products; healthy preservative-free snacks that help you find your happy balance! Our journey started with us wanting to contemporise tradition by creating innovative items that have classic ingredients with modern twists thrown in. We wanted to push boundaries to create something new but familiar. Our Greek Yogurt is an example of this. 
It has all the healthy goodness of homemade dahi, with the added punch of high protein and zero preservatives. Taking forward this love we have for innovation, we daresay we've done it again! Introducing the first No Added Sugar Greek Yogurt in India. 
Made with real ingredients and no preservatives, this strawberry yoghurt brings together the classic pairing of strawberries and cream, with ripe strawberries and thick yoghurt creating a timeless combination. Zero preservatives, high protein, real fruit content and no added sugar make this a great snack to beat the everyday hunger pangs. Give it a try and tell us what you think!

Milky Mist Lactose-free toned milk is a research-based lactose milk to meet the requirements of consumers who can't digest milk. A majority of people can't digest milk due to the lactose present in it. They are lactose intolerant and suffer from stomach pain, bloating, diarrhoea, indigestion and constipation after consuming milk. Lactose is a natural carbohydrate present in milk. This milk has pre-digested lactose thus making it consumable by lactose intolerant people too. Hence making this switch will help them live a healthier life and consume milk without any worries. Can consume it as is with sugar or even make milkshakes and smoothies. Can also add it to your favourite cereals and make your breakfast healthier. It has all the nutrients found in milk like calcium, phosphorus, vitamin D, and protein. They are crucial for healthy bones. Protein is essential for maintaining or gaining lean muscle mass and mending bodily structures. Thus it is beneficial to add milk to our diet in some form or the other. So purchase this Lactose-free toned milk exclusively on Big Basket and have it delivered right to your doorstep. Add it to your diet and live a healthier life.
